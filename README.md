<p align="center"><i>Template Next.js repository with DeSO GeoPackage functionality included.</i></p>

## Overview

This is a template repository with a basic Next.js project setup for Bodil's fullstack developer test. It contains:

- A basic Next.js app configured with the App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- A unit testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Packages and a library to query a GeoPackage file for Demographic Statistical Area (DeSO) data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
